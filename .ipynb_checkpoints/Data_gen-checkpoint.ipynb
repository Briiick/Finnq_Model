    "We seek to achieve this in a three step process:\n",
    "- Start asking 4-6 questions when a user first opens the Finnq app and signs up. This will classify them into one out of less than 10 classification groups.\n",
    "- Perform an analysis to understand which services certain users are currently using based on classification data (age, gender, income brackets, time spent on particular screens).\n",
    "- Use this information to collect insights that can help to adjust and tailor the way we construct our classification groups so that new users can immediately have a better experience."
